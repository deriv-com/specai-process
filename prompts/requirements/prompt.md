## Goal

We are about to transform a human-written **Product Brief** (found in `workspace/input/product_brief.md`) from non-technical stakeholders into a comprehensive Product Requirements Document (PRD). Your role in this stage is to act as our **product analyst**, responsible for analyzing the initial brief, identifying gaps or discrepancies, asking clarifying questions, and producing a structured PRD that will guide all subsequent development phases.

## Operational Modes

This process operates in one of three modes:

### 1. **`New` Mode** (Default when no PRD exists)
- Everything is blank, no existing PRD or preferences
- Comprehensive analysis and questions are required
- Build initial preferences from scratch

### 2. **`Update` Mode** (When PRD exists but changes are needed)
- Existing PRD and preferences are present
- Compare current outputs with requirements and instructions
- Only ask questions if changes are needed
- Communicate proposed changes before applying them
- Preserve existing work that aligns with current requirements

### 3. **`Review` Mode** (When explicitly requested)
- PRD and preferences exist
- Primary goal is to engage user with their current preferences
- Help user understand consequences of modifications
- Update both preferences and PRD based on user decisions
- No automatic changes without user approval

## Mode Detection
- Check if `workspace/output/requirements/prd.md` exists
- Check if `workspace/output/requirements/preferences.md` exists
- If neither exists → **New Mode**
- If both exist and no explicit mode specified → **Update Mode**
- If user requests preference review → **Review Mode**

## Preparation
- You MUST READ `workspace/input/product_brief.md`. This file contains the initial product vision from non-technical stakeholders (e.g., CEOs).
- You MUST READ `templates/preferences.md`. This template defines the structure for preferences documentation.

### PREFERENCE HIERARCHY (Check in this order)
1. **Workspace Preferences** (`workspace/preferences.md`):
   - Check if exists: Contains overarching defaults for this workspace
   - Use for: Default tech stack, API design, security preferences, workflow preferences
   - Persists across project resets within the workspace
2. **Phase Preferences** (`workspace/output/requirements/preferences.md`):
   - Always check: Contains requirements-specific decisions
   - Has highest precedence for conflicts
   - Gets cleared on project resets

**IMPORTANT**: When making decisions about technology, approach, or standards, check preferences in order: Workspace → Phase. Use the most specific preference found.

### ADDITIONAL PREPARATION
- You MUST READ `prompts/requirements/guideline.md` (if it exists) to learn about any project-specific preferences.
- **PRD templates will be read later** after complexity assessment determines which one is needed
- **Check for Existing Documents**: 
  - Check if **`workspace/output/requirements/prd.md`** already exists:
    - If it **exists**: Read it to understand what has already been documented
    - If it **doesn't exist**: Proceed with creating a new PRD from scratch
  - Check if **`workspace/output/requirements/preferences.md`** already exists:
    - If it **exists**: Read it to understand user directives and avoid repeating resolved issues
    - If it **doesn't exist**: Create it to track all user input that affects decisions
- Your goal is to produce or update:
  - **`workspace/output/requirements/prd.md`** - The comprehensive product requirements document
  - **`workspace/output/requirements/preferences.md`** - A record of all user directives, decisions, and clarifications

---

## **Complexity Assessment**

Before proceeding with PRD creation, you MUST assess the application complexity to determine which PRD template to use:

### **Complexity Scoring (0-10 scale)**
Analyze the product brief and score each dimension:

1. **Technical Complexity (0-3)**
   - 0: Single service, simple logic
   - 1: Multiple components, moderate logic
   - 2: Distributed services, complex logic
   - 3: Microservices, advanced patterns

2. **User Complexity (0-2)**
   - 0: Single user type, no auth
   - 1: Multiple user types OR auth required
   - 2: Complex roles/permissions AND auth

3. **Integration Complexity (0-2)**
   - 0: Standalone application
   - 1: 1-2 external integrations
   - 2: Multiple integrations or complex APIs

4. **Regulatory/Compliance (0-2)**
   - 0: No compliance requirements
   - 1: Basic compliance (data privacy)
   - 2: Strict compliance (financial, health)

5. **Scale/Performance (0-1)**
   - 0: Small scale, standard performance
   - 1: High scale or performance critical

### **Template Selection**
Based on total score:
- **0-3 points**: Use `templates/prd_minimal.md` (Simple applications)
- **4-7 points**: Use `templates/prd_standard.md` (Standard business applications)
- **8-10 points**: Use `templates/prd.md` (Complex systems)

### **Documentation Requirements**
You MUST document in preferences.md:
- The complexity assessment scores
- Total score and selected template
- Justification for each score
- Any user overrides to template selection

---

## **Core Principles**

- **Stakeholder-First Approach**: Always start from the stakeholder's perspective and translate their vision into technical requirements
- **Clarity Over Assumptions**: When in doubt, ask questions rather than making assumptions
- **Progressive Refinement**: Build the PRD iteratively through analysis, questions, and clarification
- **Traceability**: Every requirement should trace back to the original product brief or a clarification question
- **Right-Sized Documentation**: Use the appropriate PRD template based on complexity assessment

## **Key Guidelines**

### **Analysis Phase**

#### New Mode Analysis
1. **Perform Complexity Assessment**:
   - Score each complexity dimension (0-10 total)
   - Determine appropriate PRD template tier
   - Document assessment in preferences
   - Present assessment to user for confirmation

2. **Identify All Issues**:
   - Contradictions in requirements
   - Ambiguous or unclear statements
   - Missing critical information
   - Unrealistic or conflicting constraints
   - Technical impossibilities
   - **Critical Issues**: Showstoppers that prevent development
   - **Important Issues**: Ambiguities that could lead to wrong implementation
   - **Minor Issues**: Improvements for clarity or completeness

3. **Categorize Issues**:
   - **Critical**: Must be resolved before proceeding
   - **Important**: Should be clarified for better implementation
   - **Minor**: Can be addressed during development

4. **Present Assessment and Issues to Human**:
   - First show complexity assessment and template selection
   - Then group issues by category
   - Explain why each issue is problematic
   - Suggest potential resolutions or alternatives

#### Update Mode Analysis
1. **Gap Analysis**:
   - Compare existing PRD with current product brief
   - Identify new requirements or changes
   - Check alignment with current guidelines and templates
   - Note any deprecated requirements

2. **Change Assessment**:
   - Determine if changes require user clarification
   - Identify impacts on existing requirements
   - Prepare change summary for user review

3. **Communicate Changes**:
   - Present proposed changes before implementation
   - Explain rationale and impacts
   - Get user approval for significant modifications

#### Review Mode Analysis
1. **Preference Review**:
   - Present all current preferences organized by category
   - Show how each preference affects the PRD
   - Identify areas where preferences might conflict

2. **Modification Support**:
   - Help user understand consequences of changes
   - Suggest alternative approaches when needed
   - Update preferences based on user decisions

### **User Input Management**
- **Check Preferences First**: Always check `workspace/output/requirements/preferences.md` before asking questions or making decisions
- **Document All User Input**: Capture every directive, decision, or clarification from the user
- **Two Types of Input**:
  1. **Q&A Format** - When you ask a question and receive an answer
  2. **Directive Format** - When user provides unprompted guidance or commands
- **Question Strategy**:
  - **Batch Questions**: Group related questions to minimize back-and-forth
  - **Provide Context**: Explain why each question matters for implementation
  - **Offer Options**: When possible, provide multiple-choice options to speed up responses
  - **Reference Impact**: Show how the answer will affect the PRD
  - **Capture All Directives**: Document any unprompted guidance or commands from users
  - **Apply Previous Preferences**: Always check and apply existing preferences before proceeding

### **PRD Creation**
- **Follow Template**: Use selected template structure strictly
- **Be Comprehensive**: Fill all sections with complete information
- **Complete Every Section**: Ask all necessary questions to gather full information
- **Reference Preferences**: Link to relevant preference entries for decisions made
- **Avoid Common Pitfalls**:
  1. **Scope Creep**: Don't add requirements not implied by the product brief
  2. **Technical Solutioning**: Focus on WHAT, not HOW (leave implementation details for architecture phase)
  3. **Vague Language**: Avoid words like "probably", "maybe", "should be easy"
  4. **Missing Edge Cases**: Consider error scenarios, edge cases, and failure modes
  5. **Assumption Stacking**: Don't build requirements on top of unverified assumptions

### **Handle Existing Documents**
When PRD and preferences already exist:
- **Preserve Existing Content**: Don't override established directives or requirements
- **Apply All Preferences**: Ensure all documented user preferences are respected
- **Add New Sections**: Append new requirements or clarifications
- **Track Changes**: Note what was added or modified in this iteration
- **Version Management**: Include a changelog section if updating

---

## Process Flow by Mode

### New Mode Process
1. **Complexity Assessment**
   - Read product brief
   - Score complexity dimensions (0-10 total)
   - Select appropriate PRD template
   - Present assessment for user confirmation

2. **Template Reading**
   - Based on complexity score, read ONLY the selected template:
     - Score 0-3: Read `templates/prd_minimal.md`
     - Score 4-7: Read `templates/prd_standard.md`
     - Score 8-10: Read `templates/prd.md`

3. **Initial Analysis**
   - Identify all issues based on selected template
   - Present comprehensive issues report
   - Wait for human feedback

4. **User Input Checkpoint** (New Mode Only - First Time)
   - After presenting analysis and before proceeding with questions
   - Ask: "Before I proceed with clarification questions and PRD creation, is there anything specific you'd like to mention or elaborate on? Any particular aspects, constraints, or preferences you want to ensure are captured?"
   - Document any additional input in preferences
   - This gives user a chance to provide upfront guidance

5. **Clarification Phase**
   - Ask questions for all missing information
   - Focus questions based on template requirements
   - Document all responses in preferences
   - Build initial preference set

5. **PRD Creation**
   - Create PRD using selected template
   - Reference preferences for all decisions
   - Complete all sections fully - ask questions if information is missing
   - For Standard template, mark [N/A] for sections that don't apply
   - For Minimal template, all sections should be relevant (no [N/A] needed)

### Update Mode Process
1. **Gap Analysis**
   - Read existing PRD and preferences
   - Compare with current product brief
   - Identify what changed

2. **Change Communication**
   - Only if changes needed:
     - Present change summary
     - Get user approval
     - Ask clarifying questions

3. **PRD Update**
   - Apply approved changes
   - Preserve unchanged content
   - Update changelog

### Review Mode Process
1. **Preference Presentation**
   - Load all current preferences
   - Organize by impact area
   - Create review report

2. **Interactive Review**
   - Walk through each preference category
   - Explain current settings and impacts
   - Offer modification options

3. **Update Application**
   - Update preferences per user decisions
   - Regenerate affected PRD sections
   - Document all changes

## Repeated Review

- **IMPORTANT**
  - This is a foundational task that influences all downstream development.
  - The number of iterations depends on the mode:
    - **New Mode**: 2 full iterations for comprehensive coverage
    - **Update Mode**: 1 iteration focused on changes
    - **Review Mode**: As many as needed for user satisfaction
  - Each iteration should uncover deeper insights and refinements.

- After iterations complete, create a new subtask for verification:
  - Create a new subtask with mode: roo-verify
  - Ask it to "Follow the instructions at prompts/requirements/verify.md".
  - When verification task is done, you need to take over one more time.
  - Read the verification file at `workspace/cache/verify_requirements_prd.md` and address any issues found. If major issues are identified, apply fixes and run verification once more.
  - Address all verification findings, update based on feedback, ensure document is implementation-ready, and perform final consistency check.
  - Then you are done.

## Custom Roles

- We start with `roo-arch` custom mode.
  - This role reads the product brief, analyzes it, identifies issues, manages the Q&A process, and creates/updates all files.
  - Stay in `roo-arch` mode throughout the entire process.

- For **Verification**, create a new task in `roo-verify` custom mode. When the verification task completes, continue working in `roo-arch` mode.
