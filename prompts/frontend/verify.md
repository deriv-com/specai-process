# Frontend Architecture Verification

## Goal
Verify that the frontend architecture specification is complete, consistent, and aligns with system requirements, API specifications, and user stories.

## Process

### Step 1: Read Required Documents
1. **Frontend Architecture**: `workspace/output/frontend/architecture.md`
2. **Frontend Preferences**: `workspace/output/frontend/preferences.md`
3. **PRD**: `workspace/output/requirements/prd.md`
4. **User Stories**: `workspace/output/stories/stories.md`
5. **Service Architecture**: `workspace/output/architecture/architecture.md`
6. **Public APIs**: `workspace/output/api/*_public.md`

### Step 2: Verify Completeness

#### Required Sections Check
Verify all sections are present and complete:
- [ ] Executive Summary
- [ ] Technology Stack with justifications
- [ ] Architecture Overview with diagram
- [ ] Component Architecture with hierarchy
- [ ] State Management strategy
- [ ] API Integration patterns
- [ ] Routing Structure
- [ ] Authentication & Authorization flow
- [ ] Performance Strategy with targets
- [ ] Responsive Design approach
- [ ] Build Configuration
- [ ] Testing Strategy
- [ ] Deployment Architecture
- [ ] Development Guidelines

#### Content Depth Check
For each section, verify:
- Information is specific, not generic
- Decisions are justified
- Technical details are provided
- Examples or code samples where appropriate

### Step 3: Verify Alignment

#### Complexity Alignment
Check framework choice against PRD complexity score:
- **0-3**: Should use vanilla or lightweight framework
- **4-7**: Should use React/Vue with standard patterns
- **8-10**: Should use Next.js/Nuxt with advanced patterns

If misaligned, flag as critical issue.

#### API Coverage
For each public API endpoint:
- Verify there's a corresponding UI component or page
- Check API integration pattern is defined
- Ensure error handling is planned

Missing API integrations should be flagged.

#### User Story Coverage
For each user story:
- Verify it maps to components in the architecture
- Check navigation supports the user flow
- Ensure state management handles the data

Uncovered stories should be flagged.

### Step 4: Verify Consistency

#### Technology Consistency
- All technology choices work together
- No conflicting library choices
- Build tools support chosen stack
- Testing tools compatible with framework

#### Pattern Consistency
- State management pattern is consistent
- Component organization follows single approach
- API integration uses uniform patterns
- Error handling is standardized

### Step 5: Verify Best Practices

#### Performance
- [ ] Code splitting strategy defined
- [ ] Lazy loading implemented where needed
- [ ] Bundle optimization planned
- [ ] Performance targets are measurable

#### Security
- [ ] Authentication flow is secure
- [ ] Token management addressed
- [ ] XSS prevention considered
- [ ] CORS handling planned

#### Accessibility
- [ ] WCAG compliance mentioned
- [ ] Keyboard navigation planned
- [ ] Screen reader support considered
- [ ] Color contrast requirements noted

#### Maintainability
- [ ] Component reusability emphasized
- [ ] Clear separation of concerns
- [ ] Testing strategy comprehensive
- [ ] Documentation standards defined

### Step 6: Generate Verification Report

Create report at `workspace/cache/verify_frontend_architecture.md`:

## Important Notes
- Focus on architectural completeness, not implementation details
- Verify decisions are justified, not just stated
- Check for practical feasibility
- Ensure scalability is considered
- Validate performance targets are realistic
