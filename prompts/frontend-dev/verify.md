# Frontend Development Verification

## Goal
Verify that the frontend implementation is complete, follows specifications, integrates with APIs correctly, and meets quality standards.

## Process

### Step 1: Read Required Documents
1. **Frontend Implementation**: `workspace/code/frontend/`
2. **Development Preferences**: `workspace/code/frontend/preferences.md`
3. **Frontend Architecture**: `workspace/output/frontend/architecture.md`
4. **UI Specifications**: `workspace/output/frontend/ui/`
5. **API Specifications**: `workspace/output/api/*_public.md`
6. **User Stories**: `workspace/output/stories/stories.md`

### Step 2: Verify Implementation Completeness

#### Project Structure Check
Based on complexity score:
- **0-3**: Verify simple structure (index.html, styles.css, script.js)

- [ ] Tests directory (if applicable)

#### Component Implementation
For each UI specification:
- [ ] Component exists in codebase
- [ ] All variants implemented
- [ ] All states handled (hover, active, disabled, loading, error)

- [ ] Responsive behavior implemented

Missing components list:
```
[List any missing components]
```

### Step 3: Verify API Integration

#### API Client Check

- [ ] Request format correct
- [ ] Response handling appropriate
- [ ] Error cases handled

API Coverage:
```
Total Endpoints: [count]
Implemented: [count]
Missing: [list]
```

### Step 4: Verify Functionality

#### Authentication Flow

- [ ] Navigation works correctly
- [ ] Deep linking supported
- [ ] 404 handling present
- [ ] Route guards functional

#### Forms
- [ ] Validation implemented
- [ ] Error messages displayed
- [ ] Success feedback shown
- [ ] Loading states during submission
- [ ] Accessibility for form errors

### Step 5: Verify Code Quality

#### Code Standards
- [ ] Consistent naming conventions
- [ ] Component structure uniform
- [ ] No ESLint errors
- [ ] No TypeScript errors (if applicable)
- [ ] No console.log statements in production code

#### Performance
- [ ] Code splitting implemented
- [ ] Lazy loading where appropriate
- [ ] Images optimized
- [ ] Bundle size reasonable
- [ ] No memory leaks

#### Security
- [ ] No sensitive data in code
- [ ] Input sanitization present
- [ ] XSS prevention measures
- [ ] Secure token storage
- [ ] HTTPS enforced (production config)

### Step 6: Verify User Experience

#### Responsive Design
- [ ] Mobile layout works (320px+)
- [ ] Tablet layout works (768px+)
- [ ] Desktop layout works (1024px+)
- [ ] No horizontal scrolling
- [ ] Touch targets adequate size

#### Loading States
- [ ] Initial load feedback
- [ ] Async operation feedback
- [ ] Skeleton screens (if specified)
- [ ] Error state displays
- [ ] Empty state displays

#### Accessibility
- [ ] Keyboard navigation works
- [ ] Focus indicators visible
- [ ] ARIA labels present
- [ ] Color contrast sufficient
- [ ] Screen reader friendly

### Step 7: Verify Testing

#### Test Coverage
- [ ] Unit tests present
- [ ] Critical paths tested
- [ ] Component tests exist
- [ ] API integration tests
- [ ] Test scripts in package.json

Test Results:
```bash
# Run tests and report results
npm test
```

### Step 8: Verify Documentation

#### README Completeness
- [ ] Project description
- [ ] Setup instructions
- [ ] Environment variables documented
- [ ] Available scripts listed
- [ ] Deployment instructions

#### Code Documentation
- [ ] Complex functions documented
- [ ] Component props documented
- [ ] API service methods documented
- [ ] Configuration options explained
