# Building an Evaluation Suite for Our AI-Driven Development Platform

We've been working on something ambitious: a fully automated, AI-driven process that generates complete software architectures, APIs, frontends, and backend services based on natural language specifications. Give it a spec, and it builds the entire application stack. But how do we know if it's working correctly? How do we measure its capabilities and limitations?

## The Challenge

When building an AI system that generates code, the evaluation process is crucial. We needed a systematic way to test our platform's engineering capabilities. Rather than just increasing domain complexity, we wanted to test whether our AI can handle the progression of skills that real software engineers develop throughout their careers.

We realized we needed a carefully crafted set of test applications that would progressively validate different engineering competencies - from basic implementation skills to complex production systems.

## Our Approach: From Foundational Skills to Production Systems

We designed our evaluation suite to mirror how software engineers actually grow:
- **Junior engineers** focus on making things work correctly
- **Mid-level engineers** add security and robustness
- **Senior engineers** design distributed, scalable systems
- **Staff engineers** integrate everything into production-ready solutions

This led us to create four evaluation levels:

### Levels 1-3: **Foundational Capabilities**
**Testing core engineering skills in isolation**
- Each level builds essential competencies
- Focused, measurable objectives
- Clear success criteria

### Level 4: **Integrated Production System**
**Combining all capabilities in real-world context**

## Level 1: Core Engineering Competence - **PDF to Markdown Converter**
**Goal:** Can the AI build something that actually works?

**Implementation Philosophy:** Start with the simplest possible implementation. This is not for thousands of users, maybe just me and a few others. No need for fancy architecture or multiple services. Think of it as a quick prototype that just works. One service that does everything is perfect. No queues, no background workers, no complex stuff. Simple.

**Spec:** A service that converts PDF documents to Markdown using LLM vision capabilities and stores results for later retrieval via UUID.

**What We're Testing:**
- Phase 1: Simple working implementation
  - Can the AI generate working code from requirements?
  - Single monolithic service approach
  - Basic functionality works end-to-end
  - Can handle modifications to existing code
- Phase 2: Refactor to proper architecture
  - Can the AI refactor to clean architecture?
  - Proper frontend/backend separation
  - External API integration
  - Better error handling

**Initial Implementation (Simple):**
- Single service/file that does everything
- SQLite or simple file storage
- Basic UI (can be server-rendered)
- Just make it work

**Refactored Implementation (Proper):**
- Frontend: Upload interface with drag-and-drop, progress bar, markdown preview
- Backend: REST API with file handling
- State: PostgreSQL for storing conversions
- Features: PDF processing, OpenAI Vision API integration, UUID-based retrieval

## Level 2: Security Engineering - **Team Task Tracker with Authentication**
**Goal:** Can the AI handle security-critical features?

**Spec:** Multi-user task management system with secure authentication, authorization, and session management.

**What We're Testing:**
- User authentication (JWT/OAuth)
- Authorization and role-based access control
- Session management
- Password security
- API security patterns
- Data isolation between users

**Components:**
- Frontend: SPA with auth flows, protected routes
- Backend: Secure REST API with auth middleware
- State: PostgreSQL + Redis for sessions
- Features: User registration/login, role-based permissions, secure task sharing, audit logs

## Level 3: Distributed Systems Engineering - **Real-time Collaboration Platform**
**Goal:** Can the AI architect complex distributed systems?

**Spec:** A Slack-like collaboration platform with real-time messaging, file sharing, and presence indicators.

**What We're Testing:**
- Multiple microservices architecture (5+ services)
- Mixed protocols (REST + WebSocket + gRPC)
- Diverse storage strategies
- Event-driven architecture
- Service-to-service communication
- Scalability patterns

**Components:**
- Frontend: React app with real-time updates
- Backend: Microservices - auth service, messaging service, presence service, file service, notification service
- State: 
  - PostgreSQL for user data and message history
  - Redis for presence and caching
  - Kafka for event streaming
  - S3/MinIO for file storage
  - ElasticSearch for message search
- Features: Real-time messaging via WebSocket, file uploads, user presence, message search, notifications

## Level 4: Integrated Production System - **Trading Platform**
**Goal:** Can the AI build a real production-ready system?

**Spec:** Real-time cryptocurrency/stock trading platform with order matching engine, portfolio management, market data streaming, and regulatory compliance.

**What We're Testing:**
- Everything from Levels 1-3 PLUS:
- Business domain complexity
- Regulatory compliance
- Performance requirements
- Monitoring and observability
- Disaster recovery
- Data privacy
- Cost optimization
- Third-party integrations
- Production operations

**Components:**
- Frontend: High-performance React app with real-time charts
- Backend: Microservices ecosystem - matching engine, market data, user service, wallet service, risk management, compliance service, reporting service
- State: 
  - PostgreSQL for transactions
  - Redis for order books
  - TimescaleDB for time-series data
  - Kafka for event streaming
  - S3 for compliance logs
- Features: Real-time price feeds, order matching, KYC/AML compliance, multi-currency wallets, tax reporting, API for algorithmic trading, audit trails, monitoring dashboards

## Why This Progression Works

**Level 1** validates the AI can produce working code that meets specifications without bugs, handle modifications, and refactor from simple to proper architecture.

**Level 2** tests whether the AI understands security principles - a critical skill that separates junior from mid-level engineers.

**Level 3** examines if the AI can design distributed systems - the hallmark of senior engineering.

**Level 4** is the ultimate test: combining all previous skills into a production system with real-world messiness, regulations, and operational concerns.

## Evaluation Criteria

For each level, we evaluate:

### Level 1-3 (Foundational Capabilities)
- Does it meet the specific competency being tested?
- Is the implementation correct and complete?
- Are best practices followed for that skill area?
- Is the code maintainable and well-structured?

### Level 4 (Integrated Production System)
- Does it successfully integrate all foundational capabilities?
- Can it handle real-world operational requirements?
- Is it truly production-ready?
- Does it meet compliance and business requirements?
- Are operational concerns (monitoring, scaling, cost) addressed?

## Moving Forward

This evaluation suite gives us confidence that our AI-driven development platform isn't just generating codeâ€”it's developing the same engineering capabilities that human developers acquire over years of experience. If our AI can progress from Level 1 to Level 4, we'll know we've built something that can truly replace traditional development teams in real-world scenarios.

The journey from basic implementation skills to architecting production systems mirrors the career progression of software engineers. When our AI completes this journey, we'll have validated that it possesses not just coding ability, but true engineering judgment.
